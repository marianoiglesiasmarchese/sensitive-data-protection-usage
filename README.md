# sensitive-data-protection usage project
-----------------------------------
This project allows you to see how to use [sensitive-data-protection util](https://github.com/marianoiglesiasmarchese/sensitive-data-protection/tree/main) within your project.
It also does a performance comparison among different approaches:
* Non annotated classes
* `toString` overridden classes
* Annotated classes 

For the comparison it uses 100K coroutines.
